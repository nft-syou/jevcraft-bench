# JevCraft

Behavioral anti-cheat research bench for Minecraft (Paper) servers. Mining-session
telemetry is reduced to a small feature object, TypeSafe Jev answers a few typed
questions about it, and the results are scored offline against human labels.

This repository is a proof of concept. It **never** bans, kicks, or rolls back
players. The strongest outcome it produces is a request for human review.

## Status

Phase 0 + Phase 1 (offline vertical slice) are implemented:

```text
MiningSessionFeatures -> Jev questions (xray-v1) -> typed probabilities
  -> versioned DecisionRecord -> reproducible evaluation report
```

The Paper plugin (Phase 2) is not started. See `docs/handoff/JevCraft_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 (`.node-version`)
- pnpm (version pinned in `package.json` `packageManager`)
- Optional: a TypeSafe API key in `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` for live evaluation

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm jevcraft evaluate datasets/fixtures/xray-direct-001.json
```

Without `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` the CLI uses a deterministic mock backend and says so on stderr.
Decisions are written to `datasets/decisions/<input>.jsonl` (ignored by Git).

### Live evaluation

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then put your key in TYPESAFE_API_KEY
pnpm jevcraft evaluate datasets/fixtures --backend typesafe --out datasets/decisions/fixtures-live.jsonl
```

`pnpm jevcraft` loads `.env` if it exists (Node's `--env-file-if-exists`); an exported
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` works too. The key is read only from the environment. Never commit it.

### Evaluation report

```bash
pnpm jevcraft evaluate datasets/fixtures --backend mock --out datasets/decisions/fixtures.jsonl
pnpm jevcraft report --decisions datasets/decisions/fixtures.jsonl --labels datasets/labels/fixtures.jsonl
```

Produces `reports/fixtures.md` with the confusion matrix, Precision / Recall / **FPR** / FNR / F1,
a threshold sweep over `P(likely_xray)`, per-subtype and per-confidence-band breakdowns,
latency percentiles, token totals, and the list of false positives and false negatives.

## Packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `@jevcraft/schema` | Zod contracts: `MiningSessionFeatures`, `DecisionRecord`, `SessionLabel` |
| `@jevcraft/jev-evaluator` | `xray-v1` question set, TypeSafe SDK backend, mock backend, decision policy |
| `@jevcraft/eval-runner` | Label join, metrics, Markdown report |
| `@jevcraft/cli` | `pnpm jevcraft evaluate` / `report` |

## How a session is judged

One request per mining session. Jev is asked four independent questions:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `behavior_class` | choice | `legit` / `suspicious` / `likely_xray` / `insufficient_evidence` with a full probability distribution and a confidence |
| `hidden_information_use` | noul | P(player acted on hidden ore-location information) |
| `route_naturalness` | score 0..4 | 0 = highly unnatural, 4 = strongly natural (`normalized = score / 4`) |
| `evidence_sufficiency` | noul | P(enough evidence to classify) |

The policy (`packages/jev-evaluator/src/policy.ts`) turns these into
`insufficient_evidence` / `high_priority_review` / `review` / `no_action`.
Thresholds are provisional and must be tuned from labeled data.
`confidence` is a statistic of the distribution shape and is not `P(likely_xray)`.

## Data hygiene

- Missing values are `null`, never `0`.
- Player ids must be pseudonymous. No real UUIDs, names, chat, or IPs in any dataset.
- `datasets/private/`, `datasets/decisions/`, and `reports/` are ignored by Git.
- Fixtures under `datasets/fixtures` test the wiring; they are not proof of accuracy.

## Development

```bash
pnpm check        # lint + typecheck + test
pnpm format       # apply Biome formatting
```

CI runs the same commands plus a mock evaluation. Live Jev calls are never made in CI.
